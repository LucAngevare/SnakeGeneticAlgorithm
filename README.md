# SnakeGeneticAlgorithm
Alright, I'll add a serious readme.md because people seem to be interested.
I made this project as a sort of show-off project for the "talented" people of my school (they called this project TopTalent), for this you had to team up with a teacher and make a project. I was inspired by the YouTube channel codebullet to create a self-playing game.

# main.py
This is the file that calles all files together and makes the Neural Network/Genetic Algorithm play the game.

# Snake_Game.py
This is the file where the game itself is created.

# Run_Game.py
This is the file where the Genetic Algorithm communicates with the game and tells it to do what and when.

# Genetic_Algorithm.py
This is the file where the genetic algorithm itself is being created.

# Feed_Forward_Neural_Network.py
This is the file where the Genetic Algorithm gets trained.
